# "Hide" - Jekyll & Hyde Theme, the WordPress Edition

This is my WordPress Theme Edition of the "Hyde" theme - design style **strongly inspired** by the beautiful "Hyde" theme for Jekyll _(another blogging software)_.

# Installation / Usage

## 1. Upstream - you need the default theme 'Twenty Fifteen'.

This simple theme modification should be applied to a [default WordPress theme by WordPress.org called Twenty Fifteen](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/).

_You may already have this base theme installed depending on your version of WordPress - if not, install the theme "Twenty Fifteen" on your blogs login under 'Appearance > Themes > Add New'._


## 2. Customise 'Twenty Fifteen' by pasting in this CSS code.

Customise the Twenty Fifteen WordPress theme on your blogs login by going to 'Appearance > Customise' under the 'Additional CSS' section, paste the CSS code in the file `hide-wordpress-mod.css`. 

_This will modify the default Twenty Fifteen WordPress theme to look like Poole's Hyde theme for Jekyll._
